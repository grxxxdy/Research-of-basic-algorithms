# Task:  
1. Find all three-digit prime numbers and determine their quantity.  
2. Write a function to convert a natural decimal number to the quaternary numeral system and a function for the reverse conversion. Test with several examples.  
3. Calculate the product of numbers starting from the second number in the Fibonacci sequence up to the Nth number inclusively, using recursion (without using loops). The first two values in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1. Each subsequent value is the sum of the previous two values, so the sequence looks like: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on. For example, when N = 6, the program should output 30.
